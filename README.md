# Introduction
Here you will find the code that was used to make the mobile version of the Targex stat sigs. It makes extracting player stats from XGen's API absolutely painless.

# Instructions
1. Copy the StatSig.php file to your directory.
2. Make a new file, name it whatever you want (I'll call mine index.php).
3. Include the StatSig.php file in your index.php file, like so:

    ```php
require_once("StatSig.php");
```
4. Use the Targex namespace:

    ```php
use Targex\StickArena\StatSig;
```
5. Initialize an instance of the StatSig class:

    ```php
$player = new StatSig($_POST['username']);
```
  * Note: $player and $_POST['username'] can be renamed to whatever you want; however, if you're making a stat sig site I recommend keeping them as they are.
6. From here it's rather intuitive, you just use it like this:

    ```php
echo $player->get_kills();
```
7. Save index.php
